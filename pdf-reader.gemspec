  ********************************************

  v1.0.0 of PDF::Reader introduced a new page-based API. There are extensive
  examples showing how to use it in the README and examples directory.

  For detailed documentation, check the rdocs for the PDF::Reader,
  PDF::Reader::Page and PDF::Reader::ObjectHash classes.

  The old API is marked as deprecated but will continue to work with no
  visible warnings for now.
