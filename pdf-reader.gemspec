  ********************************************

  This is an alpha release of PDF::Reader to gather feedback on the proposed
  API changes.

  The old API is marked as deprecated but will continue to work with no
  visible warnings for now.

  The new API is documented in the README and in rdoc for the PDF::Reader,
  PDF::Reader::Page and PDF::Reader::ObjectHash classes.

  Do not use this in production, stick to stable releases for that. If you do
  take the new API for a spin, please send any feedback my way.
